I know some of you want the old wall texture from v0.1 so if you want to then here you have.
You can replace it and I gave you backup just in case.

Copy and paste it in map and map2 to work because map2 uses the old maps and map uses the new ones. (Am planing on merging them when I will be done with the rooms)
